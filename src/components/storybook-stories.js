/*
 * STORY-BASED EXAMPLES
 *
 * Please add stories below to use Storybook Stories (http://localhost:9001)
 * as the basis for manual review and a development sandbox. New components
 * should also be added to `story-based-tests.jsx` in order to automatically
 * add DOM and image snapshots. With enough Storybook story examples, these
 * two methods should be significant to fully test components with the
 * exception of callback testing. Please test callback props with the Mocha
 * framework (http://localhost:8001).
